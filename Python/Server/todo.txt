========================================================
	Things to do.
========================================================

[] - change the exception output to be more informative
and give general usage information

[] - Change the way command line arguments are handled.
Since there are only two (at the moment). I've decided
to put a single flag for specifying which type of connection
to use 

[] - Add more command line arguments to change settings like the hostname of the server, proxy servers , ip address, port number, and other networking tomfoolery
